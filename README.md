2. **Token Balance:** The application connects with a smart wallet to show the user's token balance in USDC.

3. **Real-Time Exchange Rate:** The application fetches real-time exchange rates to ensure accurate conversion between the tokens and the recipient's local currency.

4. **Recipient Details:** Users can select the currency they want to send using a drop-down list.

5. **Form Submission:** After entering all the details, users can submit the form to process the transaction.

## Components

### TransactionForm Component

The main component responsible for collecting transaction details from the user. This component manages form submission and integrates with `react-hook-form` for validation and form handling.

#### Props:

- `formMethods`: Object containing `react-hook-form` methods.
- `onSubmit`: Function to handle form submission.
- `stateProps`: Object holding the transaction state (e.g., token balance, exchange rate, recipient name).

#### Example:

```tsx
<TransactionForm
  formMethods={formMethods}
  onSubmit={handleTransactionSubmit}
  stateProps={transactionState}
/>
```

### SelectField Component

This component renders a customizable select dropdown for selecting currencies. It integrates with `react-hook-form` for validation.

#### Props:

- `id`: The unique identifier for the select input.
- `label`: Label text for the select field.
- `options`: Array of options to display in the dropdown (each containing `value` and `label`).
- `defaultValue`: Default selected option.
- `formMethods`: Object containing `react-hook-form` methods.
- `validation`: Object containing validation rules for the input.
- `error`: Error message to display if validation fails.
- `disabled`: Boolean to disable the dropdown (e.g., while loading).

#### Example:

```tsx
<SelectField
  id="currency"
  label="Currency"
  options={[
    { value: "NGN", label: "Nigerian Naira (NGN)" },
    { value: "KES", label: "Kenyan Shilling (KES)", disabled: true },
    { value: "GHS", label: "Ghanaian Cedi (GHS)", disabled: true },
  ]}
  defaultValue="NGN"
  formMethods={formMethods}
  validation={{ required: "Currency is required" }}
  error={errors.currency}
/>
```

## Validation Rules

### TransactionForm

- **Amount:** Must be a valid number between 0.5 and 500 USDC, with up to four decimal places.
- **Currency:** Required, and must be one of the supported currencies (NGN, KES, GHS).

### SelectField

- **Required Validation:** The select input can have a required validation rule that ensures the user selects an option.

## Customization

To customize the form fields or extend the functionality:

1. Modify the currency options:

   - In the `TransactionForm` component, edit the `currencies` array to add or remove supported currencies.

2. Update validation rules:

   - In the `TransactionForm`, modify the `validation` object passed to `register` to add custom validation rules for the form inputs.

3. Add new fields:
   - Add new inputs to the form in `TransactionForm.tsx`, register them using `react-hook-form`, and update the submission logic.
